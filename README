This is an implementation of a constrained hidden Markov model in PRISM.
The particular implementation is a pair HMM which is usuable for constrained
sequence alignment. The implementation includes a few well-known global
constraints which may be used with the model.

The purpose of this implementation is to illustrate implementation principles
of constrained HMMs.
